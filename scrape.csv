Earthquake Forecast Map,"This full stack web GIS application implements the Django framework to render a responsive earthquake forecasting map. Potential earthquakes are predicted with Python by embedding an automated machine learning engine within the application. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and accessed via REST API endpoints, allowing the front end to present the data with HTML5, CSS, and Leaflet.",Winter 2020,https://brian-rafferty-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/project_pics/earthquake_forecast_map_UL6e0Sn.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAUD7F3C5TVKPQ5UOL&Signature=tEznXt7mMogjd5XHtWLh9IrRWb4%3D&Expires=1595959480
Blog Web Application,"This web app implements the MVC schema and Django framework to promote scalability through the creation of applications and routes. The front end was designed in HTML5 with CSS bootstraps, and back end functionality was added with Python and a SQLite database. I created two applications for this project that implement CRUD operations, and included an authenticated login system to allow secure access to content.",Winter 2020,https://brian-rafferty-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/project_pics/blog.gif?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAUD7F3C5TVKPQ5UOL&Signature=nQ72wGZsZ6tfLM3g2i5LlX7NzCs%3D&Expires=1595959480
Earthquake Forecast Dashboard,"Here is a web GIS application that uses Flask to display a dynamic earthquake forecasting dashboard. Potential earthquakes are predicted on the back end with Python using machine learning, and the front end is rendered with Bokeh. The dashboard is responsive and displays data in a number of ways, including a map, bar chart, pie chart, and line charts.",Winter 2020,https://brian-rafferty-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/project_pics/earthquake_forecast_dashboard_fnvVvMk.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAUD7F3C5TVKPQ5UOL&Signature=%2Bx%2Bf1e%2FVownyIT55JDUe4ukcKqo%3D&Expires=1595959480
Movie Rental Web Application,"I designed this full featured web application with C# and the .NET framework to provide a platform for a movie rental company. Utilizing a SQLite database on the back end, it stores the current supply of movies that are available for rent and supports all CRUD operations. Additional functionality was coded in with C# to allow users to filter movies by title and genre.",Winter 2020,https://brian-rafferty-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/project_pics/75171-davidfriedman-gettyimages-1652097_3Sssw2E.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAUD7F3C5TVKPQ5UOL&Signature=IVoiJ8zYStBNlsFwb6D25rpewaE%3D&Expires=1595959480
Tweet Location Scraper,"I designed this Python program to scrape location-enabled hashtag data from Twitter using the Tweepy library. The user starts by inserting their Twitter Developer credentials and a desired hashtag phrase, at which point all Tweets containing those tags are scraped from the API and printed to a CSV file if they have location data enabled.",Summer 2019,https://brian-rafferty-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/project_pics/twitter.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAUD7F3C5TVKPQ5UOL&Signature=Ei1cO8nQNg0wu7drTy04FDoJ01Y%3D&Expires=1595959480
Multithreading,"This is an application that mimics a card game by creating 4 threads to run concurrently. Each thread is scheduled to run at a different speed, and they are managed using semaphore system calls. The threads operate as unique processes that print the current card in the hand of a player to an output file until all four players have exhausted their portion of the deck.",Summer 2019,https://brian-rafferty-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/project_pics/D1338_3_507_1200_PsQl58p.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAUD7F3C5TVKPQ5UOL&Signature=0YBeceJWbiJ1CtbGZnf2EqBBlHc%3D&Expires=1595959480
SIC/XE Disassembler,"This project was the culmination of 2 months of hard work to develop an application to take in a file containing object code, translate the contents into its corresponding assembly, and write the results in the correct format to an output file. I devised a system to streamline the process that saved time and space by using OOP, which efficiently handled conversions and formatting.",Spring 2019,https://brian-rafferty-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/project_pics/SIC_XEAssemblyProgram_HFYZTE5.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAUD7F3C5TVKPQ5UOL&Signature=5IXCbQGQ2JWy7kzXAqhZoC75lAE%3D&Expires=1595959480
Stadium Map,"The intention of this map is to display the locations and data associated with stadiums around San Diego. Java on the front end allows the map to be dynamic, users can alter the visual extent and toggle popups for each stadium. A special addition to this map is that the SQL database also contains photos, which required a stored procedure to correctly add the data for each row.",Spring 2019,https://brian-rafferty-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/project_pics/Petco_2015_T1_KlPHPXw.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAUD7F3C5TVKPQ5UOL&Signature=9IxNTrWxt%2BfMWKPMbw5vo2kE90w%3D&Expires=1595959480
